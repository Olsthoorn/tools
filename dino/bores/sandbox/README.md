# Parsing boregholes defined in a workbook exported by the Strater program.

This directory is to further develop the analysis of bores specifield in
an excel workbook, in this case "Boorgatgegevens.xlsx" containing
the data of a number of recently drilled boreholes in Limburg, NL.

The idea is to define a grammar that parses the lithological description
of each drilling into codes defined by TNO, so that the drillings in the
workbook can be converted to xml files as TNO does and then be plotted,
individually or in profiles.
